# Possible attacks for my lab 3

Look for unknown output, seg faults, or kernel panic

multiple del_timer calls. Find a state where a function accesses the time pointer after it has already been freed.
- timer_handler to delete timer, proc show or char dev read to access the timer->expires
- add robust pointer checks
- This would cause kernel panic or seg fault

Race conditions in shared variables. Global variables with no locks
- rapidly open/close/write to the device file to trigger a race condition that corrupts kernel memory and system crash
- Implement locking
- this would cause unexpected output 

Buffer overflows in writing data. 
- mytimer_write, the user can supply an input string that is parsed using strsep. pass unexpected input structure or very long string
- mytimer_read, if message is very large it could overflow the 256 byte line buffer
- validate input lengths
- this would cause kernel panic or unexpected behavior

Deprecated APIs
- asm/uaccess using raw_copy_to/from_user
- use up-to-date APIs
- this can cause vulnerabilities
