# Possible attacks for lab 3

Attack 1:
Input: Create timer, delete timer, read dev file, proc show, repeat until seg fault.
Output: Seg fault
Description: Null pointer access. There could be multiple del_timer calls. Find a state where a function accesses the timer pointer after it has already been freed.
Fix to problem: Check if the timer is active before trying to access the timer pointer in proc_show.

Attack 2:
Input: Rapidly write to the file to set the message variable and start a timer.
Output: Only supports one timer but the message variabe would be set multiple times, so it would either make a timer with a different message or seg fault.
Description: Race conditions in shared variables. Global variables with no locks like the message variable.
Fix to problem: Put a lock on all shared variables.

Attack 3:
Input: A really long timer message or start a very long timer.
Output: Unexpected behavior or seg fault.
Description: Buffer overflow. If they are not checking for a message that is too long or a time limit for the timer, you can overwrite other information in the stack.
Fix to problem: Check that user input is in an expected format.

Attack 4:
Input: Create timer, delete timer, delete timer
Output: Seg fault
Description: Null pointer access. If they don't check for timer already being deleted, then deleting twice would cause a seg fault.
Fix to problem: Check if the timer is active before trying to delete the timer pointer.
